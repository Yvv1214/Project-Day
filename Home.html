      <p id="p1">Hello my name is Vanessa and this is a practice web page project. In this website I am going to write about some of the many places
        I would like to visit one day. I have earned an AAS in Nanotechnology and now learning front end web development. With these skills 
        I hope to have a career with great flexibility and pay in order to be able to someday grow my wings and travel. Europe's way of way life,
        South America's culture, Asia's traditions, the clear water at the Carribean's and much more. But here I am going to write a little about
        the three places I would like to travel to: Japan, Singapore, and United Kingdom. </p>
