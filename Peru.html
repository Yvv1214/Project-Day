                <p>Lima is the capital of Peru near the Pacific coast. The city has both an ancient and modern feel to it. You can travel around the 
                    city by bus or by horse carriage. Go paragliding near the beach or take a walk at the Park of Love and view its sculptures and mosaic
                    wallls. Learn some history about the Spanish Conquerer Fransico Pizarro at the Cathedral of Lima and witness the mixture of architectural
                    styles that make up the gold plated altar. Also, at Museo Larco you can about Peru's pre-Columbian history. During the day cool off at
                    the Park of the Reserve. Walk through various unique water water fountains that get you wet or those that you can walk under through and 
                    not get soaked. At night, witness the the Magic Water Circuit, a light show provided the park's water fountains.

                <p> A good place for thrill seekers, is a town built around a lake and surrounded by sand dunes. Ride dune buggies, go sand boarding, or relax
                    on a boat at the lake. There are tours from Ica, to ride horses in the desert, Ballestas Islands Boat tours, and a winery tour just a few hours
                    away from Huacachina. </p>

                <p> The Peruvian Amazon is filled with exotic plants and animals. Many choose to stay at an eco lodge and enjoy nature for a little bit. During
                    the day visitors take a cruise around the forest, while others hike with a tour guide educating them about the forest's inhabitants. </p>
